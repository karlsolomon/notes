Schedule session with Bethany (in-person) and Taylor (virtual) May 2
Schedule session with parents (in-person) May 9
Are relationship anxieties just a normal trauma response or are they OCD (self-harm vs perfectionism/just-right)?
Talk through perfectionism pathway for professions
Ask for more frequent sessions (2x / week if possible)
I struggle with re-attributing step (assigning blame to OCD instead of self). I think I mostly know when obsessions are happening, but I have a hard time "passing the buck". I almost feel a responsibility to have the obsession.

By obsessing about the fear I am losing the ability to be present in conversation. This forces me to concentrate on "what" was said rather than "why/how". In essence it prevents me from being an active and critical listener.

Chapstick: felt urge to put on chapstick, was talking about chapstick out loud so the urge to lick lips/put on chapstick increased. We did a dry-run of ERP where I delayed putting on chapstick for ~25 minutes. Although I was uncomfortable and distracted in the conversation, the SUDS went from 5 -> 2. My lips actually did get chapped beyond what I am normally comfortable with, however, after putting the chapstick on they seemed to be revived more than expected. Lesson learned: I have more time margin to apply chapstick before lips get seriously bad.
Homework:
        Next Time:
                Unpack Self Harm (H not suspicious of this) v Perfection
                Build Tolerance to feared outcome. Feared outcome is where uncertainty is. We catastrophize the feared outcome. Outcome is not as bad as we make it out to be.
                Move to 2x per week (maybe one consistent Monday hour slot open)
