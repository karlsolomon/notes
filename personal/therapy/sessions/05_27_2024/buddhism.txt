Thought: I wonder if archlinux users are more likely to have perfectionism OCD

I should probably start meditating about removing ego and tolerating letting go

Basically I need to let go of my core fear/belief in order to actually achieve it.
I was in a position to make an impact/difference at NVDA. However, because I was
so afraid to be seen as incompetent due to catastrophizing I ended up causing
self-fulfilling prophecy. However if I don't give a shit about making a difference
I'll be able to actually achieve that
