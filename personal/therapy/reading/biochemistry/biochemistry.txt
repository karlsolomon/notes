        Increased activity in the caudate nucleus head inhibits globus pallidus fibers from dampening thalamic activity. Increased thalamus --> increased orbitofrontal cortex activity via cingulate gyrus which increases activity in caudate nucleus. A positive feedback loop.

Globus Pallidus - Controls conscious and proprioceptive movements. Supports motivation/cognition. (Is this *motivation* why I've felt the need for testosterone?)


Loop:
Orbital Frontal Cortex --> Cingulate Gyrus --> Striatum (caudate nucleus + putamen) --> Globus Pallidus --> Thalamus --> Frontal Cortex.
