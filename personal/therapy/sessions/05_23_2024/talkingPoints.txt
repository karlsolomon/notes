Exposure Plan
    Need to get good at not ruminating --> stay mindful in current situation
        "how do you respond to initial temptations to ruminate"
        need to get good at being in the moment and tolerating uncertainty (maybe/maybe not)
        choose mindful awareness
    Relationship failing:
        - Need to do better next time, not "I'm worthless". "Roll with the punches".
            * Need to give self a break for having gone through a tough time. *** This is the thing that's going to be really hard to change.
        - Challenge assumption that I could've been there for a friend in need and just failed. Because I'm in a survival state I'm having to devote my resources for my own wellbeing. Can't realistically have expected myself to be there for them. I'm "trying to stay safe". Reframe: I wasn't in ventral-vagal rest/digest, this is where I'd need to be to be there for others. Look at that and assign external locus of control. Tone down the ego. Goal is to get to ventral vagal as default. To make choices based on values, not survival. I did the best I could wi hthe tools I had at the time, but once I was given the tools to handle OCD I'm now able to handle the situation better. Think of OCD as similar mental reaction to seeing a grizzly bear.
        - Selfishness is why we evolved as a species. Applying ventral/vagal qualities to sympathetic state.


Resources:
    - Holding off in event of
    - Doing self-compassion workbook via B's recommendation
Homework:
    - Whenever you have free time, do exposures
        * OK to repeat exposures multiple times


Self-Compassion Book: I have a really hard time saying
    "this was unavoidable"
    "blame lies on OCD"
If condition is fully recoverable by thinking about it, then shouldn't it also be preventable?
Was it that I wasn't able to intuit that these are irrational thoughts? Or that I simply ignored that it is irrational

In session:
Obsessional doubt may not be irrational, but over-evaluated
I'm just underestimating the potency of survival response.
    nervous system is too high priority for intelligence. think of the intelligence as like lazy loaded
Difficult to hop out of grooves
Look up mirror rubber arm experiment

Why did I start avoidance in the first place?
    dealing with core fears --> strong reaction
    Once you start to avoid you reinforce idea that avoidance is viable and it makes it easier to avoid
    Response used to be "fight", but at Nvidia it switched to "flight"
Once I started compulsing, why did I continue to do compulsions?
    Need to do the opposite of the compulsion to reinforce that it is not a worthwile compulsion.

Do I think someone in that role would need to ask for help at times?
    YES.

    Need to accept that there are multiple types of outcomes from asking for help. Some good, some bad. Need to hold space that either is possible and I just have to deal with the consequences. Needs to be willingness to step "toward" undertainty. Must be willing to accept that misinterpretations/reputation doesn't matter if you are doing your best.
    Value: be productive. Know that to do that I need to engage in a trigger.
    Pre-therapy: logic says just do it, but OCD is louder. First time I engage in the compulsion, get felt sense of certainty which is MAJOR dopamine hit for nervous system.

    Possibility of getting into car accident. Brain isn't flagging it as critical b/c it isn't attached to a core fear.
    Sense of relief comes from preventing the doubt/uncertainty in the first place.

    SYK overworking was also compulsing. Triggering behavior was confronting person saying/thinking I'm incompetent/incapable.
