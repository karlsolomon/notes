Cassandra reached out to me 3 days ago (Sunday, Mar 31) to say that her&david missed me. I was ignoring/avoiding that communication in much the same way I have for all others in the friend group. While I was looking through the iocdf.org site I saw GGOC app and believe that I've seen Cassandra using this app before. I know that David has clinical depression so I guess discovering that Cassandra might have OCD it inspired me to reach out to them to discuss my circumstances. I feel like learning that I have OCD has made it a bit easier to talk to people about my situation. It feels like it gives me a way to save face since I can blame OCD instead of just admitting to being a shitty neet/no-life.

That being said. Now that I have scheduled the call I'm super anxious about it. I started the day with a lot of energy and optimism, but now that this is looming I'm way more compulsive. Frequently checking my phone. Difficulty focusing on a task. Wanting to change my environment frequently to escape the anxiety. 

I hope to discuss no only recent diagnoses, but also how I was fired while I was living with them. This would be a pretty big step since it breaches wall of separation I've put up between myself and anyone from this group since I mentioned to Gabe that I was depressed during the pandemic (and while I was still at nvidia). Also, lol just did the math and if I stayed there I'd currently have ~ 2 million in stocks (after tax). This doesn't feel great :/
