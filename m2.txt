Call with MP.
Discussed OCD diagnosis, what I've been doing for past 2 years, and anxiety around work.
He was happy that I'm not dead, he was worried about so many things that this seems like not a big deal compared to what he was imagining.
Offered to write detailed letter to his boss to recommend I work for them.
I declined since I'm not ready for work again - out of coding practice and worried I'll end up with similar avoidance behaviors.
He mentioned that he has similar social anxieties at work, feels like he doesn't have people he can confide in and when he runs into issues it causes him a lot of distress since he doesn't have people he can ask for help. However, he still made a point to not minimize my reaction/feelings.
We discussed his upcoming wedding (May 4) and I promised I'd attend.

After the meeting I felt like he was willing to do whatever it takes to help me get back on my feet. Honestly very inspiring/reassuring. The meeting went better than I'd imagined and help instill a lot of confidence. It makes me wonder who (if anyone) would take up a similar position.
