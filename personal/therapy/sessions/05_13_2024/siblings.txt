TL;DR

1. Concerned that Bethany will be ostracized by OCD professional community if she provides any education/help.
    - Consequently I've been largely resistant to her suggestions/input.
    - Can I use her suggestions for readings, etc.?
2. Concerned that I'm disrupting their lives
    - newlywed stuff
    - intrude on Taylor's wfh environment

        * Soft contract being done
        * I'm kinda picking up chores for Taylor
        * Economy is bad so not going out as much as we'd like - trying to save
        * Karl's personalizing lifestyle, and imagining a better lifestyle than they realistically have
3. Concern that I'll slip back into bad habits as soon as I leave
    - Felt strong urge to do this when I went back to SJC and saw my room again.
    - TODO in future exposures

How can I leverage B's experience and T's similar condition (OCPD) to help myself improve faster/more fully?
    - Basically a compulsion trying to figure this out, so not discussing. lol


Taylor
    - initial observations: hygeine, stuck in room, more open since therapy/medication
    - soft contract was that I do chores & get therapy/medication
    - pushed out of living spaces 3x when not ready, empathetic with recovery
Bethany
    - painful for her to see how limited I've felt from OCD
        - work, relationships, dating
    - made substantial progress since being here. But
    - Want to know how she's accommodating

    TODO: discuss what I'm supposed to do when hearing B's input
