TL;DR

1. Concerned that Bethany will be ostracized by OCD professional community if she provides any education/help.
    - Consequently I've been largely resistant to her suggestions/input.
    - Can I use her suggestions for readings, etc.?
2. Concerned that I'm disrupting their lives
3. Concern that I'll slip back into bad habits as soon as I leave
4. Concern

How can I leverage B's experience and T's similar condition (OCPD) to help myself improve faster/more fully?
