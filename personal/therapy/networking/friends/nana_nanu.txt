Called Nana/Nanu with Bethany. I did a lot of the talking. Basically just let them know what's been going on. We scheduled to resume our weekly (Sat 9am PST) calls. I was coerced into the exposure from B, I probably wouldn't have scheduled a call with them so soon, and I was reluctant to place the call when the scheduled time came, but it was good that we went through it. I don't particularly feel the need to ruminate on the call, however for some reason it does give me a general anxiety that makes me uneasy and want to hermit. I have been resisting that urge, but it crops up at different times throughout the day. Probably SUDS 3-4. I should probably schedule a visit with them in the not-too-distant future.
