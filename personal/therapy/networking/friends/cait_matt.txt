Annie is OCD Counselor, has OCD
Cait has depression, but I didn't know because I'm not in movie knights :/
Setup BBQ and tell everyone there
They're supportive of me, but felt a bit awkward about me telling them. Not nearly as uncomfortable as Gabe, but moreso than David/Cassandra.
Anxiety level prior to call was pretty high. Maybe in the 4-7 range depending on the time. Fairly high soon after scheduling the call and the hour before the call.
I hermited today. Maybe partially because I wanted to sleep a bit more from tough workout yesterday, but also because I found it hard to be motivated to work on stuff because I just kept wanting to ruminate on the upcoming call.
