- Talk through perfectionism pathway for professions (+ college selection)
- I'm staring to make some progress on studying for work again (actually learning things) and I frequently get anxiety from ruminating/wishing that I had known this stuff while working.
- Seen progress with chapstick dependence. I was able to go a whole morning without it nearby. Although I had some intrusive thoughts it was easier to dismiss them.
- Did exposure call w/ Grandparents: understanding/patient/happy
- I struggle with re-attributing step (assigning blame to OCD instead of self). I think I mostly know when obsessions are happening, but I have a hard time "passing the buck". I almost feel a responsibility to have the obsession.

Homework from last session:
- Make notes on thoughts after getting urge to go touch grass, then at least get in car.
                "I want to touch grass, but I need to (IWTTG) do this computer thing first. That's more important since it can help prepare me for getting job again."
                "IWTTG charge my phone/headphones up first."
                "IWTTG rest since I didn't sleep well."
                "IWTTG do laundry since I don't have any clean soccer shorts."
                "IWTTG wait until my new cleats come in."
                "IWTTG find my keys <I don't know how, but I had actually thrown them in the trash..."
                "IWTTG skip today since I have gym bro appointment and I want to be fresh for that."
                "IWTTG eat first."
                "IWTTG go when I'm coming back from XYZ since I'll already be out."

- Mentally review the "Functions" V SUDS, but do not log
                Basically didn't want to do it until morning before appointment since I'm worried I'll forget if I don't log it (similar to my approach to doing assigned readings in primary/secondary school).
