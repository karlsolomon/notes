Mindfulness:
    Shower Observations:
        - Definitely needs to be cleaned, lots of cat hair around the edges
        - Probably one of the longer showers I've taken in a while
        - I have chest hair growing on my anterior shoulders now
        - HR
            - before shower (sitting) 16/15
            - imm. after shower (standing) 17/15
            - 3 min after shower (sitting) 13/15
        - Remembered that I hadn't taken medication yet that day
        - Remembered that I hadn't texted back the friend of friend
        - Thought about upcoming pt appointment and that I hadn't eaten much today so should eat before its too late
    - After phone call w/ Online MS program: 16/15

@ Heidi - motivation to learn HPC stuff in a MS program:
    so there's definitely some motivation to learn about HPC in order to confirm to myself that I can learn it and I'm not just an idiot -- why I've been blaming myself for failing at nvida.
    However, I think there's genuine value in learning the material since it would help me write better code in multiple domains.
    Should I
        - not do it b/c OCD would get encouragement/relief by taking it
        - take it because I value taking it

Noticed that I'm sweating a lot more while having these conversations, doing this research. Kept feeling the need to put on deodorant.


Notifying Linkedin connections of profile update = 8 SUDS
w/ exposures I need to engage with less than 100% completion

Homework:
logon to LinkedIn as often as it isn't a checking compulsion
come into contact with exposure/vulnerability
    no checking that it wasn't responsded to positively.
    instead, loging on to revisit the fact that the info is out there and can be perceived however they want to.
    if it seems to become reassurance seeking/checking then stop doing the exposure.

Also explore experiencing anxiety - talk about how I'm not "imagining" it.
