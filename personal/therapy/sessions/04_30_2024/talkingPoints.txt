* Talk through perfectionism pathway for professions (+ college selection)
* I'm staring to make some progress on studying for work again (actually learning things) and I frequently get anxiety from ruminating/wishing that I had known this stuff while working.
* Seen progress with chapstick dependence. I was able to go a whole morning without it nearby. Although I had some intrusive thoughts it was easier to dismiss them.
- Did exposure call w/ Grandparents: understanding/patient/happy
- I struggle with re-attributing step (assigning blame to OCD instead of self). I think I mostly know when obsessions are happening, but I have a hard time "passing the buck". I almost feel a responsibility to have the obsession.

Homework from last session:
- Make notes on thoughts after getting urge to go touch grass, then at least get in car.
                "I want to touch grass, but I need to (IWTTG) do this computer thing first. That's more important since it can help prepare me for getting job again."
                "IWTTG charge my phone/headphones up first."
                "IWTTG rest since I didn't sleep well."
                "IWTTG do laundry since I don't have any clean soccer shorts."
                "IWTTG wait until my new cleats come in."
                "IWTTG find my keys <I don't know how, but I had actually thrown them in the trash..."
                "IWTTG skip today since I have gym bro appointment and I want to be fresh for that."
                "IWTTG eat first."
                "IWTTG go when I'm coming back from XYZ since I'll already be out."
                This all seems very much like a "just right" kind of mentality. Is very reminiscent of how I was at NVDA.

- Mentally review the "Functions" V SUDS, but do not log
                Basically didn't want to do it until morning before appointment since I'm worried I'll forget if I don't log it (similar to my approach to doing assigned readings in primary/secondary school).
                Ended up not doing it entirely. Need to become comfortable with uncertainty, especially when it allows me to engage in other activities that I value.



In Session:
                Discussed IWTTG rationale. Focused on "more optimal time later". Basically chose not to TG because I felt the need to continue to prepare for interviews/work.

Homework
                Do the "functions" spreadsheet
                Goal: become more comfortable with "uncertainty". Want to get to the point where we're saying "maybe I was incompetent at NVDA, can't know for sure".
                Goal: Want to habituate IWTTG and live with "uncertainty" that I may not be as prepared for an interview as I could have been.
                New SUDS worksheet: Trigger => "I will not/delay doing this compulsion" => =>
