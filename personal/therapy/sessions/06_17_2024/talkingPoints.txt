Difficulty maintaining a routine

Inner critic:
    Relationships - It feels like I'm very self-absorbed. Inner critic wants me to feel like a terrible human because of this.
        Grandmother is in poor health and I was never really close with her. Inner critic wants me to feel bad for not having a closer relationship with her or feeling particularly sad.
        I have a weekly call with another set of Grandparents that I'm much closer with. Even though I know this is a good way to maintain the relationship it feels like a chore.
        Generally I don't do a good job of reaching out to others - friends/etc.
        Unreliable to people who need me/help so how could I ever start a family?
    Worthless
        Lacking motivation to better myself means I'll never accomplish anything

Ruminations:
    Relationships
        How I've failed to maintain certain relationships
        How I failed to form any meaningful relationships at nvidia
        How I struggle to want to form new relationships since I'm worried I'll fail to keep them up too
        How I failed to follow up on some relationships with people who are also struggling

    My ruminations are all "confirming" the negative outcome/conclusion.
        This type of rumination is not
    They are not seeking relief.

    Issue: massive ego makes me feel like the rules of the nervous system don't apply to me. I "should" be able to overcome.
        Fear of reaching out from help came from an experience which triggered "unsafety" feeling from lack of connection.

        I perfectly described the "freeze" response (survival). This is not a "self-absorption" response. This is exactly what I did with the Grizzly Bear interaction. First is to scan fight/flight. If I'm feeling overwhelmed, but don't have faculties to resolve task at hand. Nervous system would not continue to fight a task


    Can't really call it "self-absorption" when it was the exact same kind of situation with the Bear. Self-absorption can only come into play when you're in upper half of Maslow's pyramid. Inner critic is asserting that top of pyramid shortcomings aren't due to bottom of pyramid needs, when they actually are.

    Need to be careful and have compassion for the part of brain that works for survival. Expecting a part of brain that was shut down to be the continued driver.


    Since I'm equipped with same nervous system as others I shouldn't expect different results.

    I'm protecting fragile ego which is in place to

    Think on "feared posible self" when involved with core fears/beliefs/inner critic. Need to think of efficacy of "exposure work"

    Goal of exposures is to rewire brain to

    Get curious about how that narrative developed about core fears.
    Type of reasoning that people with OCD engage in. Not looking to invalidate the reasoning, but acknowledge why it is flawed given current conditions/circumstances.
    "Inferential Reasoning"

    Blend exposure work and ICBT
        Heidi has been self-studying for a while, but it seems like it would be very helpful for me
