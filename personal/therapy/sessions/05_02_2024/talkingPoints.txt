* Talk through perfectionism pathway for professions (+ college selection)
* I'm staring to make some progress on studying for work again (actually learning things) and I frequently get anxiety from ruminating/wishing that I had known this stuff while working.
* Seen progress with chapstick dependence. I was able to go a whole morning without it nearby. Although I had some intrusive thoughts it was easier to dismiss them.
* Nail biting
* Did some setup improvement and now I have a lower barrier to doing things on computer since experience is better. Makes it easier to resist avoiding and handle the anxiety. Will start trying to do at least 1, target 2 coding problems a day as exposures.
* Yesterday did a coding problem that I know I've solved in a more optimal way before. Implemented a better than 70% solution, however wanted to keep working on it. Found another solution, but wasn't better and felt OK leaving it after that even though it wasn't "perfect". I usually aim for top 10% in those kinds of scenarios. I could tell that OCD wanted me to feel like a failure for not attaining that, but I was able to relabel/dismiss that and not feel terrible afterward :D

From Last Session:
    Do the "functions" spreadsheet (triggers.csv)

In Session:
    Discussed the various "triggers" behind rumination about past relationships. Came away with the realization that I am so uncomfortable with the idea of failure that whenever I can't help but admit failure I feel an endless need to pay penance in order to make up for it/undo the damage. Because of this I have a very hard time doing anything or being in the moment.

Homework:
    New SUDS worksheet: Trigger => "I will not/delay do/doing this compulsion" => =>
