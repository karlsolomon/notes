Checked LI every day (except Sunday), had someone view my profile on private mode every day. At first it gave me anxiety, but now I kind of don't care.
    - Thoughts about reaching out to colleagues on linkedin who I've left hanging. (@Dipayan @Isaac)

No response from the college professor so far.

Been doing more leetcode problems. Was able to solve a problem that I couldn't solve a couple of years ago. Didn't have optimal runtime/memory complexity, but it was average and I was able to leave it at that. Though I did think about continuing to work on it XD.
 
Date is on, but haven't set day/time yet.

Been finding it difficult to do the boring parts of the compilers class. Made lots of progress while doing lectures/quizzes, but now that I'm on the programming assignment (and have a lot of reading to do) I'm avoiding it.

Also been avoiding working on my resume for college applications.

Was also super fatigued last Thursday/Friday. Didn't sleep much on Wednesday night, then slept basically all day/night Thursday/Friday.
Taylor and Bethany were worried that I was "regressing", but really I was just really tired. Though I did no call no show to gym appointment, so that's some OG bad behavior.


Having a hard time focusing on the "most important" task.

Good at convincing myself that other things are important in the moment.

Goals by next sessions:
    - At least have outline/structure for new resume (since I lost my original template).
    - Have written some code (maybe just defining regex for tokens) for compilers project.


H: power is how you respond to inner critic. Not looking for certainty to negate fears. If it is a valued behavior (to provide context), we want to promote living life of valued behaviors even when the behavior leads to distress/uncertainty. Have to own that OCD could be a reason why people want to not work with me - ridiculous.

Headed back to San Jose for weekend - might invite a few of them there.



Exposure:
    1. Respond to left hanging former colleagues
    2. If response, let them know about OCD. Take ownership of the experience.

Penance:
    I feel like I've ruined the potential future
    I did take myself off the path, however it is negligent to ignore OCD's role in the matter. It controlled survival instincts.
    Did I lose privilege of allowing new ventures to go okay? Does it feel like things have to be hard to matter?       yes, yes.
    Is trying to walk new path with OCD not hard enough?
        inner critic says no.
    If there's no limit to what will amount to forgiveness, what does that set me up for? You made your bed, now you have to lie in it.
    It would be particularly hard to make a positive lasting impact (value) given the position that I'm forcing myself into.

Next time: explore inner critic/penance philosophy. Need to focus on core beliefs first.
