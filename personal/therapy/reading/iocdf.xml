<summary>Review of ERP and OCD definitions/examples</summary>
<takeaways>
    <takeaway>My most prevalent obsessions: Perfectionism (need to remember, fear of forgetting, making mistakes) and Contamination (although this may be my mis-appropriating perfectionism obsession).</takeaway>
    <takeaway>I have experienced, at least since university, perfectionism-related obsessions</takeaway>
    <takeaway>Prior to WFH my perfectionism compulsions were largely beneficial from a professionalism standpoint, but maladaptive from a quality of life standpoint. After WFH my compulsions were entirely detrimental.</takeaway>
    <takeaway>ERP is most successful CBT for OCD patients. Generally faster/better restults when taken in-parallel with SRIs.</takeaway>
    <takeaway>Further research on Emotional Contamination is needed</takeaway>
    <takeaway>Use FOSS as exposure training ground for coding.</takeaway>
