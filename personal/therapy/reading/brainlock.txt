    Obsession - Intrusive thoughts

    4 R's
        Relabel - identify obsessions/compulsions for what they are
        Reattribute - assign cause of thoughts/urges as OCD
        Refocus - respons to thoughts/urges in constructive way
        Revalue - conscious/non-automatic, but relatively trivial dismissal of obsessions/compulsions and resume normal/constructive life.
    
    OCPD - me working in groups middle school - college & (possibly) at Stryker. Possible that Matt helped me get over this. "Doesn't care that uncompromising behavior annoys others"
    
    OCD = dislike the behavior, OCPD = like the behavior.

Ch 1 - Relabel
    Flooding - throwing pt in "deep end" to directly confront fears. Usually not successful.
    Pt must "fight back/show defiance" against compulsion. This sounds similar to what I felt immediately before calling David/Cassandra. Prior to OCD diagnosis I have contemplated seeking out testosterone therapy since I feel I am far more "apathetic" and have way less "fight" in me than I did before.
    Pt must leverage idea of Adam Smith's "Impartial Spectator" to rationally distinguish real from OCD anxieties.
    Boredom is biggest enemy of OCD recovery. Even if it's not the best job you qualify for, just having something to get out and be responsible for is important.
    Common for people w/ OCD to be attracted to one another. Interesting in that this could self-propagate the disorder.
    Use "ridiculous" spell from Harry Potter to trivialize the obsession.
    
    Endearment toward the compulsion leads to life spinning out of control.
    Helpful to keep diary/notes on progress.
    Relabeling - identifying & demonizing obsessive thoughts s.t. you have no urge to engage in the compulsion.

Ch 2 - Reattribute
