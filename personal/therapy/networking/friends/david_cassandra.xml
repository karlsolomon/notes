<summary>Confessed unemployment and mental health situation to dharris and charris.</summary>
<takeaway>They were worried they'd be losing me as an accessible friend, but my confidence in them made them feel honored.</takeaway>
<takeaway>They did not suspect that I was unemployed.</takeaway>
<takeaway>They did not feel like I've been as shitty of a friend as I feel/believe.</takeaway>
<takeaway>I can live with them again if I need.</takeaway>
<takeaway>I was able to resist the avoidance compulsion, however I had to engage in several other compulsions (still keeping my mind pre-occupied), and being in a "safe" environment in order to feel like I could handle it.</takeaway>
<takeaway>I was earning $170k + 724 shares per year. At current share price that works out to around 800K per year pre-tax, 570K after tax</takeaway>
<takeaway>When something is still relatively far away my desire to resist the avoidance compulsion is low. When something is about to happen and I've "signed up for it" my resistance to avoidance compulsion is high. A sense of urgency and short-term goals will probably help my recovery.</takeaway>
<takeaway>They were very receptive, patient, and supportive.</takeaway>
