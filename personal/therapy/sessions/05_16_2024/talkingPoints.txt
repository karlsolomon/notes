0. Last week's session
    - T: I feel like most of our discussions are totally normal, but B seems to feel like a lot of it is ruminating together. Thoughts?
    - H's thoughts:
1. Because I feel like I haven't made much progress recently I'm starting to resort to some old thoughts/practices: Catastrophizing, avoidance/distraction
2. Talk about Stogo
3. Thoughts on return to SJC. Should I do a dry-run when we feel like I could be ready?
4. Future reading? I felt like reading Brain Lock was good for me so hoping for more of that.
5. Many personal coding projects I've undertaken in the past are mainly enabling OCD compulsions:
    - LED/Lights control: optimize sleep and utility bill
    - Grade checker: prevent distraction
    - Holter Monitor: actually for benefit of others
    - MoleLens: actually for benefit of others

P.S. Good news:
    - I've been doing fingernail exposure and it's largely been successful. Most of them are longer than they've ever been. Only really slipped up on like 1-2 of the nails in past few days.

    - Played 1st soccer game since being in Phx
