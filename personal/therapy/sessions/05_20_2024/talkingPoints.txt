Exposure Plan
    Need to get good at not ruminating --> stay mindful in current situation
        "how do you respond to initial temptations to ruminate"
        need to get good at being in the moment and tolerating uncertainty (maybe/maybe not)
        choose mindful awareness
    Relationship failing:
        - Need to do better next time, not "I'm worthless". "Roll with the punches".
            * Need to give self a break for having gone through a tough time. *** This is the thing that's going to be really hard to change.
        - Challenge assumption that I could've been there for a friend in need and just failed. Because I'm in a survival state I'm having to devote my resources for my own wellbeing. Can't realistically have expected myself to be there for them. I'm "trying to stay safe". Reframe: I wasn't in ventral-vagal rest/digest, this is where I'd need to be to be there for others. Look at that and assign external locus of control. Tone down the ego. Goal is to get to ventral vagal as default. To make choices based on values, not survival. I did the best I could wi hthe tools I had at the time, but once I was given the tools to handle OCD I'm now able to handle the situation better. Think of OCD as similar mental reaction to seeing a grizzly bear.
        - Selfishness is why we evolved as a species. Applying ventral/vagal qualities to sympathetic state.


Resources:
    - Holding off in event of
    - Doing self-compassion workbook via B's recommendation
Homework:
    - Whenever you have free time, do exposures
        * OK to repeat exposures multiple times
