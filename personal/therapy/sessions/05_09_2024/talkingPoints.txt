Nail clippers : tSolomon :: chapstick : kSolomon
    (also bring up eyebrow/hair pulling)
Want to encourage Mom to receive her own therapy. How to de-stigmatize seeking professional help.
    Discuss Mom's verbage (always, never, have to, must, etc.)
Discuss tSolomon's potential religious scrupulosity

Goal:
    Process what it was like when I was living with them 2.5 years ago.
    Try to understand where my obsessions/compulsions came from.
    Encourage Mom to get therapy.
    Discuss Sara's "OCD list of O's and C's" and how parents relate to each.

CalmOCD documentation "if you're spending all day thinking about chapstick, just go get it". Seems like it's rcommending to just give into the compulsions.

When I was back in San Jose last weekend seeing my room again made me feel the urge to relapse: just stay in bed all day and do nothing, talk to no one.

tSolomon:
    Feel like he failed while I was staying with them.
    When I'm in the bathroom and not coming out.
    He gives me a lot of credit. Has confidence that I'm always able to work through my own problems. Any assistance he provides would just get in my way/make it worse. Didn't know what to do.
    Feels regret that he didn't provide help where he could've.
    "I always thought Karl would work his way through it."
    "I tried to handle your situation similar to how I'd handle coworkers in similar situations".
    Retired so that he could be available for bSolomon's wedding, kSolomon since I was going through difficulty, and his health.
    "We were enabling the whole time".
    Knew situation at multiple times before (Ted Emerson said he couldn't find me + 1 monitor).
    Get's really angry when self/others make the same mistake many times. Frequently just "go with it", but other times I'll "pop off" at them. Mom receives a lot of this anger. Saw similar anger in father and grandfather.
    Obsession: Control or Perfection?
        Angry with self or anyone else who makes same mistake repeatedly. More tolerant of strangers, but people you're with frequently gets under his skin.
        Maybe core fear is an incompetence/incapability one? "What does it say about me if I'm unable to learn from this mistake".
        Greenberg - "Have to make conscious decision to stop ruminating". tSolomon: "I can't stop ruminating, all I can do it something else to take my mind off of it".
        "Ruminating is not a compulsion, rather it *causes* compulsions".
        Ruminate about being angry. Pray to try to get out of it. "Prayer is a good thing".
        "Are there any examples of OCD where people have compulsions, but not rumination?" "I never get to a compulsion without ruminating first".
        "I think it's natural to ruminate. Takes me days to get out of a rumination"
        "I didn't realize how much prayer has helped me until I read these papers".
        "The only good thing about me is the things God has done in my life. It's much harder to be 'worthy' by yourself".
        Scrupulosity: "Fear of disappointing God". Very disappointed that I wasn't grateful enough of my conversion to stop myself from doing ungodly/immoral acts.
        "For all the things I marked/identify with: I'm glad I have these obsessions, they're all good things."
            "Excessive concern with moral right/wrong. Failure to do this is 'not living in the real world'. I feel I don't obsess over these things enough."
    Compulsion: Ritualized eating habits

rSolomon:
    We think has harm to others subtype. Brought me 4 chapstick tubes because she knows I always carry them and frequently want multiple.
    Talk about OCD-isms from family.
        - Charles: Compulsion
        - Father: Counting times you chew food.
    Felt she needed to be momma bear as a reaction to Bethany/john experience & my getting bullied on the school bus.
    Still ruminates on Laura's childhood/upbringing/relationship with her family.
    She sacrificed herself to make sure rest of family is taken care of.
    Ruminates on past experiences of getting "ripped off".

Discuss when HR was calling parents (emergency contacts) & cops to see if I'm still alive.
