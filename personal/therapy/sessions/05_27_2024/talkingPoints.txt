* Felt a strong urge to ruminate on Nvidia while working on cmake program. I was able to relabel it as an intrusive thought and within a minute or so I was able to resume working on stuff. A bit later that day I did, however, fail to refocus when encountering another intrusive thought due to nvidia stocks going up and people always wanting to talk about it. So I ended up exhibiting avoidance behavior again to distract myself from ruminating on it. TL;DR I'm happy that I was able to employ the 4 steps to resume working, however I'm disappointed that I failed to do so literally just an hour later. Ended up preventing me from doing anything else productive basically for the rest of the day.
* Haven't made any more progress on the ICBT self-compassion book. I'm instead starting to look into Taoism teachings since I feel like they kind of align with the teachings from this program so far. Read first 1/3 of Tao Te Ching and the whole 'sitting in discomfort' philosophy seems to vibe pretty well. "The beauty lies in uncertainty"
* Started to think about if I should meditate in the mornings to encourage myself to be mindful and let go of desires.
* Started to think about Taoism stuff when I was thinking about how I was in a position at Nvidia to "make a difference" and achieve the core goal, however the core fear basically took me away from being able to be in the moment and focus on the task at hand. Its kind of like because I fear not being able to make a difference that when put in a position where I could easily make a difference I got in my own head and screwed it up. If I just didn't care as much about making a difference or could tolerate not making a difference I likely would've ended up actually achieving that goal.
