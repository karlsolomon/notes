* Discuss Travis Call
* Felt a strong urge to ruminate on Nvidia while working on cmake program. I was able to relabel it as an intrusive thought and within a minute or so I was able to resume working on stuff. A bit later that day I did, however, fail to refocus when encountering another intrusive thought due to nvidia stocks going up and people always wanting to talk about it. So I ended up exhibiting avoidance behavior again to distract myself from ruminating on it. TL;DR I'm happy that I was able to employ the 4 steps to resume working, however I'm disappointed that I failed to do so literally just an hour later. Ended up preventing me from doing anything else productive basically for the rest of the day.
* Haven't made any more progress on the ICBT self-compassion book. I'm instead starting to look into Taoism teachings since I feel like they kind of align with the teachings from this program so far. Read first 1/3 of Tao Te Ching and the whole 'sitting in discomfort' philosophy seems to vibe pretty well. "The beauty lies in uncertainty"
    could shelve it if not servicing
* Started to think about if I should meditate in the mornings to encourage myself to be mindful and let go of desires.
* Started to think about Taoism stuff when I was thinking about how I was in a position at Nvidia to "make a difference" and achieve the core goal, however the core fear basically took me away from being able to be in the moment and focus on the task at hand. Its kind of like because I fear not being able to make a difference that when put in a position where I could easily make a difference I got in my own head and screwed it up. If I just didn't care as much about making a difference or could tolerate not making a difference I likely would've ended up actually achieving that goal.
    heidi: yes, exactly
    by having the goal, we work towards avoiding the inverse of that happening. You have to get out of your own way. Currently strongarming trying to make it happen. Be aware of he fear, but not payint it attention. White-knuckling the steering wheel and trying to fight the waves of circumstance. Need to acknowledge that fear is there, but we can't control everything. Allow circumstances to work in my favor without getting in my own way.
    Because OCD was fueling the "need" to feel certain that it happened. I wasn't trusting of the process that I would do things naturally and that they'd unfold positively.
    Best way to get good at acceptance by repeatingly being put in positions where I can accept the uncertainty. This motivates me to intentionally seek out exposures since I can practice having to accept. The more often I take the "acceptance" route the more I'll be able to tolerate uncertainty and seeing what will unfold.  Ihave to give up the certain/known path in order to uncover the beauty that could happen by taking the uncertain path.
    First time I've done much "revaluing"
* Mention how I've been using these sessions to wear new clothes that I intend to wear when resuming work in the future as a way to see if they feel comfortable. I'm concerned that wearing stuff for the first time in a pressure situation would make me distracted so I'm kind of reassuring myself that the clothes won't be distracting to me. Is this like OCD seeking reassurance or is this normal?
* Travis asked me what my 3/6 month plans are? Should I start making short & long term goals/targets like this or is that counterproductive to our work? Like is putting a timeline on recovery setting myself up to fail and therefore have something to ruminate on? Alternatively, would this actually be an exposure that we should plan for?
* Failed to pick up drug refill on Saturday so I'm going to be unmedicated for 2 days (Sunday & today), since I think they're closed Monday for the holiday as well.

Some exposures that I think I should do:
* Make Resume
* Dating profile app, maybe start trying to connect
* 2 hour limit - didn't do it first day or two, but did the last 2 days and it actually felt good b/c I felt like I accomplished stuff that I wanted to do during that time and it was nice to use the features.

Homework:
    - let go of the ripple effect of the lying narrative by telling someone what my plan is. Instead tell the plan but allow for flexibility that the plan *can* change, evne due to internal motivation reasons. Lying presupposes intentionality. Need to instead acknowledge that internal circumstances can cause me to not meet claimed goals, but not catastrophizing that into "I'm a liar" narrative. It isn't necessary to apply a meaning to not achieving the mentioned goal/timeline. Plans are allowed to change based on either external or INTERNAL circumstances and that's OK. More imortant than obsessing on the failure, I can instead refocus on what I'm able to do now.
    Colleagues have the free will to determine how they feel about me at any given time. I can't control for thatand shouldn't try to control it.

    Exposures: not some crazy self-harming thing that I'll dread. Exposures can be planned or unplanned. Need to invite constructed opportunities to take the uncomfortable/tolerant path.
    - Still do the 2 hour exposure.
    - Instead delay the RICEing until some time. Until then do something that I genuinely value, don't just avoid. Today is after dinner, but tomorrow can use intuition & trusting myself to choose a different time. Flexibility/sloppiness is the goal since it allows uncertainty.
    - Challenge the "liar"/untrustworthy exposure. Not trying to disprove the fear, but instead allows opportunities to challenge. Let's verbalize intention for first interview date and first relational date. Communicate with Bethany and Taylor that I have established expectations. They'll be able to know if I followed through it or now. Open myself up to flexibility that it may or may not happen. Also go to gym at least 3 days this week. Goal is to suspend the default narrative that I just lied. Trust intuition that I just valued something else in the moment/interim. Hope for, but do not force, no fallout from the failure.

    Continuing to limit to 2 hours
    Delay start of RICing at variable times
    Allow to not get 2 hours for a day if it doesn't make sense for that day. Trust that this is OK and doesn't threaten my perceived identity.
    1st date
    Apply to 1st job. I'm not going to tell Heidi *WHY* it didn't get done. Don't make excuses or even assign it to personal failing.
    Gym x days/wk

    goal is even if I fail to continue doing what I value next

    Offer 2 hour charge today.
