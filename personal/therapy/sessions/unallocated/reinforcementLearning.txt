10 minutes late - traffic
2 minutes discussing note-taking app/infrastructure
20 minutes discussing conversation with mphillips, and dharris/charris. She wanted to know my "emotions/feelings" during the call. Although I had these in my .txt files I didn't include this level of information in the takeaways. Maybe I should consider that moving forward.
20 minutes discussing re-inforcement learning. Probably a bit of a waste of time.
